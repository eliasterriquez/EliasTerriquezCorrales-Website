        <p class="lead mb-4">The name I go by is my legal name which is Elias. There is not a specific way that you have to say it and my pronoun is he. The major I choose was pre- business due to having a strong liking to numbers and the interaction with people. Currently Iâ€™m living in Corona, CA which is around 15 minutes from UCR. At times it can be difficult for me to express what I believe. My social skills have not always been so great I was once timid and shy due to being insecure and not being confident in myself. I knew the only way I would overcome this challenge was to get out of my comfort zone and leave the fear of being embarrassed to the side. Youth and Government helped me overcome this.<br><br>

        During my lifetime I have attended many events that help my community.  I have helped my school district when a teacher was running to be part of the board of my district. It was something as small as putting stamps on letters and sending them out to houses so they would support him and vote for him. Every year I also like helping with the events that my local YMCA hosts. I was able to be part in an event where we ran a small fair for the kids of my city. Another event the City of Corona does every year is called Lobster Fest where I serve the food to the guests of the event. In these events we could just be picking up trash and being ushers. We also like helping our local veterans and their families during the holidays. For Halloween we would give a pumpkin to each kid and on Christmas we would have a Santa Claus taking pictures with the kids and giving them presents. Our program is known around the city for helping around the community. Whenever an organization hosts an event, they call us and ask to help them run the event. Whenever I help the community, I enjoy the feeling of seeing other people having a good time. I enjoy whenever they invite me to be part of an event. <br><br>

        The Science and Technology Club was a special place to me. I learned a lot about science and technology based on books and activities. We always had some activities like making paper airplanes to improve our handmade skills. By flying the paper airplanes, we also learned the knowledge of the angle on the top of the airplanes would influence how far the airplane flies. Before the beginning of fall quarter, I had to make the decision of living on campus in UCR or staying at home. I decided to live on campus at a dormitory on campus named Pentland Hills. While living on campus I found many differences from living at home and from living on campus. The differences I realized were from my everyday life to the food I ate. Due to Covid living on campus was an interesting experience.
